Description: Implements estimation methods for shrinkage covariance matrices
    using user-specified covariance targets. The covariance target is a structured
    matrix towards which the unbiased sample covariance is shrunk, optionally
    incorporating prior knowledge. Shrinkage intensity is computed analytically.
    The method is described and applied to microarray gene expression data in
    Jelizarow et al. (2010) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq323>.
